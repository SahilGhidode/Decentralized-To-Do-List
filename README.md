# Decentralized To-Do List (Task Manager)

## 📝 Project Description
A smart contract-based task management dApp where users can create, update, complete, and delete their tasks securely on the blockchain. Designed for transparency, immutability, and personal productivity in a decentralized environment.

## 🌟 Project Vision
To provide individuals and teams with a decentralized task management system that ensures transparency, ownership, and trustless tracking of work items without relying on centralized services.

## 🔑 Key Features
- Add new tasks with timestamps
- Toggle task completion status
- Edit existing tasks
- Delete tasks permanently
- Access task details by ID
- Only the contract owner can manage tasks (can be modified later for multi-user access)

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Support for multiple users (with user-specific task lists)
- Integration with front-end using Web3.js or Ethers.js
- Reminder notifications through oracles
- IPFS-based task attachments
- Upgradeable contract structure
